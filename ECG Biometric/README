Scripts:

"getMatrices.m": Reads the dataset files ands constucts training, testing feature matrices and training, testing labels. Writes these into train_test.mat file

"classification.m": Performs classification (SVM) by using trainin and testing matrices created before and shows the result.

"eer.m": Calculates the Equal Error Rate(EER). and shows the result

*"benchmark.m": Combination of the above three scripts, "getMatrices.m", "classification.m", "eer.m".

To get the results, you can run either "benchmark.m" by itself or "getMatrices.m", "classification.m", "eer.m" in this order.
