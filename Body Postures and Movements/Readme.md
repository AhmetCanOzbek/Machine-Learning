In this project, I applied distribution free, statistical classifiers and support vector machine to correctly classify human activities (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) from the data collected by sensors positioned on the human subjects.(Human Activity Recognition)

LibSVM and PRtools are used in Matlab.
Dataset: 5 Classes, 18 Features
