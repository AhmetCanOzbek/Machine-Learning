-Feature Extraction:
1) Take R-275 , R+275 for each heartbeat and then apply PCA it to reduce it to 30 dimensions 2) Take all possible combinations of time duration and amplitude difference between PQRST peaks (20 Combinations hence 20 dimensions)
Total Dimension of the feature vector = 30 + 20 = 50
-Classification and Results:
SVM RBF Kernel Parameters: C = 50 , gamma = 2
Training Data: Accuracy = 99.9008% (5035/5040) (classification) Testing Data: Accuracy = 91.1111% (861/945) (classification) Identification Error After Majority Vote: 0%
EER: 2.4599%


Helper Functions: 
*"remove_noisy_segments.m"
*"normalize.m"
*"filter_ecg.m"
*"convert2NumLabels.m"


Scripts:

"getMatrices.m": Reads the dataset files ands constucts training, testing feature matrices and training, testing labels. Writes these into train_test.mat file

"classification.m": Performs classification (SVM) by using trainin and testing matrices created before and shows the result.

"eer.m": Calculates the Equal Error Rate(EER). and shows the result

*"benchmark.m": Combination of the above three scripts, "getMatrices.m", "classification.m", "eer.m".

To get the results, you can run either "benchmark.m" by itself or "getMatrices.m", "classification.m", "eer.m" in this order.
